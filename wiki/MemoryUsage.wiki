Tokyocabinet keeps a cache of leaves that can grow quite big by default.  By playing with the {{{leaf_node_cache}}} and {{{nonleaf_node_cache}}} parameters you can control this growth in exchange for more I/O.  Note these are the size of the caches in units of leaves; the number of entries in a leaf is controlled by the related parameters {{{leaf_members}}} and {{{non_leaf_members}}}.

Check the documentation for the open methods to see how to specify these parameters.
