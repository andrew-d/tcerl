= Overview =

There are two pieces: tcerldrv, the C driver; and tcerl, the Erlang code.
Both pieces use automake to build.[[#1 1]]

= tcerldrv =

  * The default prefix is "/usr".  If you don't like that, make sure to use the --prefix configure option.

  * You need pkg-config.
        * Ubuntu/Debian: aptitude install pkg-config
        * OS/X (fink): apt-get install pkgconfig
        * freebsd: [http://www.freshports.org/devel/pkg-config install the port]
        * others: please let me know so i can update here

  * You need tokyocabinet with development headers; I use version 1.2.5, and haven't tested other versions.
        * Ubuntu (hardy): aptitude install libtokyocabinet-dev
		* others: Download and build the [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tokyocabinet/tokyocabinet-1.2.5.tar.gz?modtime=1209093521&big_mirror=0 source]

  * You need erl_driver.h.
        * Ubuntu/Debian: aptitude install erlang-dev
        * OS/X (fink): apt-get install erlang-otp
        * freebsd: [http://www.freshports.org/lang/erlang install the port]
        * others: please let me know so i can update here

= tcerl =

  * The default prefix is wherever tcerldrv was installed, if that can be found in the path, otherwise "/usr".  If you don't like that, make sure to use the --prefix configure option.
        * If you chose a different prefix when installing tcerldrv, use application:set_env/3 with the tcerl application variable 'tcerldrvprefix' to let the code know where to look.

  * You need a working Erlang installation.
        * Ubuntu/Debian: aptitude install erlang
        * OS/X (fink): apt-get install erlang-otp
        * freebsd: [http://www.freshports.org/lang/erlang install the port]
        * others: please let me know so i can update here

  * You need [http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/EUnit eunit] to run the tests.  It's advised you run the tests if you are installing onto an untested environment.
        * If the tests fail, output is in tests/{{{*}}}.test.out

= Tested Environments =

  * Ubuntu i386 gusty

They are actually built from source using [http://code.google.com/p/fwtemplates framewerk]; tcerldrv is an [http://code.google.com/p/fwtemplates/wiki/FwTemplateCWalkthrough fw-template-c] project and tcerl is an [http://code.google.com/p/fwtemplates/wiki/FwTemplateErlangWalkthrough fw-template-erlang] project.  However dist tarballs are supposed to be indistinguishable from other automake dist tarballs, so you can ignore this.
